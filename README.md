Errata to Decision Making Under Uncertainty: Theory and Application

These items have been fixed in the second printing and later.

* Alg. 4.12 (line 4): replace ; with | to be consistent with the notation used in this section (Jon Cox)
* Eq. 6.11: switch a and s in the transition function to be consistent with the notation in the book (Max Egorov)
* Eq. 2.61: (v_i - \hat\mu) should be squared
* P. 59, sentence before eq. 3.3: replace u^1 with c^1 (David Wagner)
* Sec. 3.1.1: in independence condition, second \succ should be \succeq (Ellen Blaine)
* Fig. 3.6: The code used to generate this figure had a small bug. The histograms should be more distributed as shown [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/sisl/aa228-notebook/blob/master/07-Games.ipynb).
* Sec. 4.2.4 (last sentence): replace "2*epsilon*gamma/(1-gamma)" with "2*epsilon" (Zongzhang Zhang)
* Sec. 4.7.1 (second to last sentence): drop "and m" (Hamza El-Saawy)
* Fig. 6.6: some of the alpha vectors did not print correctly (noted by Yi-Chun Chen); the figure should look like this: <img src="alphavectors.png" alt="fig.6.6" width="300">
* Sec. 6.4.5 (second sentence): replace "each belief state B" with "each belief state in B" (Zongzhang Zhang)
* Ch. 7: references 12, 15, 38, and 63 should have "POMDPS" and "MDPS" changed to "POMDPs" and "MDPs" (Zongzhang Zhang)
* Eq. 6.31: should be $\sum_s b(s) \sum_{s'} O(o \mid s', a)T(s' \mid s, a)$ (Junzi Zhang)

This item will be fixed in a later printing:

* Alg. 4.1: U should have \pi as a superscript everywhere (Benjamin Antin)
* Eq. 4.24 and 4.27: The rightmost Ta should be transposed.
